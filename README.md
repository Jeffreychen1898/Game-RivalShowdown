# Rival Showdown

This is a game I made with my classmates in highschool for a class project. There is an online version and an offline version.

## Online Version
* folder: "Regular Version"
* Run the server code on any machine
* Navigate to the "RivalShowdown.pde" file and modify the "IP" variable to your computer ip

## Offline Version
* folder: "Offline Version"
* navigate to "/Offline Version/RivalShowdown/res/gameData/keyBindings.txt" to modify keybinds
